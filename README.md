# image classification miniproject for the "Pattern Classification and Machine Learning" course I've taken in 2012
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a support vector machine (SVM) binary classifiers are implemented to classify MNIST digits.

The current implementation classifies 3-vs-5 and 4-vs-9 but can be used to classified any other pair of digits or image classes.

A 10-digit classifier can be constructed on top of the existing code using e.g. a 1-vs-all stategy.



**The project in its entirety was done with my classmate Paul.**
